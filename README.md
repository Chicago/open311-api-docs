# Open311 API Documentation

Currently in beta. This documentation is replacing the API documentation currently located at the city's [developer's site](http://dev.cityofchicago.org). This repository is being developed alongside the new City of Chicago developer website ([repo](https://github.com/Chicago/dev.cityofchicago.org)). Contents from this site will be in dev.cityofchicago.org/docs/open311/.
